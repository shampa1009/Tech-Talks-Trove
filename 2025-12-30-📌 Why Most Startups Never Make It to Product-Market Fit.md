📌 Why Most Startups Never Make It to Product-Market Fit

Most founders think their product will win because it has great features, clean UI, smooth UX or strong tech.

Reality check 👉 people don’t buy features; they buy solutions.

Product-Market Fit basically means:
If your product disappears tomorrow, will your users genuinely feel the pain?

When PMF hits:
 🔥 Customers start finding YOU
 🔥 Retention shoots up
 🔥 Word-of-mouth grows automatically
 🔥 Every bug becomes “urgent” for users (because they actually care!)

But without PMF:
 ❌ Discounts don’t work
 ❌ Churn goes up
 ❌ Sales feel forced
 ❌ Growth is expensive and draining

💡Start small. Solve a painful problem. Talk to your users. Iterate fast.

💡PMF isn’t a milestone, it’s a mindset.

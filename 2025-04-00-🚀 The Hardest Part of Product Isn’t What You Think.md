🚀 The Hardest Part of Product Isn’t What You Think

No book teaches you how to operate when:
📌 The roadmap is set in stone
📌 No one talks to users
📌 Success = speed, not impact

The real work?
🛠️ Shaping a system that rewards learning, not just shipping
🤝 Bridging silos & clearing invisible blockers
📊 Modeling a better way: user-focused, data-driven in output-driven cultures

This invisible work burns people out. Not because they’re bad at product, but because they carry the friction of doing it right in a company not built for it.

💡 If you have someone like this—creating clarity, making space for better decisions—don’t take them for granted. When they leave, you lose the glue holding it all together.

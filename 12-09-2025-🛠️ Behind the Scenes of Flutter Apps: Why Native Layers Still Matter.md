🛠️ Behind the Scenes of Flutter Apps: Why Native Layers Still Matter

💬 Recently, আমাদের App Dev team NDK issue face করেছে - a reminder that even with Flutter, native layers matter.

Cross-Platform ≠ Cross-Problem-Free
যখন আমরা Flutter দিয়ে cross-platform app বানাই, আমরা ভাবি:
 👉 এক codebase → দুই platform (Android & iOS)
 কিন্তু আসলেই কি এতটা simple? 🤔

📱 Android Side (NDK)
 🔧 Flutter apps rely on NDK (Native Development Kit)
 🛠️ NDK compiles the C/C++ native parts of Flutter engine & plugins
 ⚠️ Common issues during release: 
 🔄Version mismatch 
 🧩Missing ABI/architecture support
 ❌Native plugin dependency errors
💡 Think of ABI like a language translator between your app and the device hardware. If the translator doesn’t understand the device’s “language” (ABI) → things break. ABI ensures the native parts of your app can run correctly on different CPU architectures.

🍏 iOS Side (Xcode & CocoaPods)
 🔧 Here, NDK নেই, instead Flutter depends on Xcode toolchain & CocoaPods.
 ⚠️ Release blockers often come from:
 🔄Xcode version mismatch
 🧩arm64 vs simulator build conflict 
 🔑Code signing & provisioning profile issues

💡 যদিও Flutter apps Dart-এ লেখা হয়, release pipeline পুরোপুরি native layer-এর উপর নির্ভরশীল. That means:
 ✅ Keep NDK & Gradle aligned (Android)
 ✅ Keep Xcode & CocoaPods aligned (iOS)
 
🔑 In short: Debug builds may run smoothly, but release builds often break because of these hidden native dependencies. Planning & proactive testing এই stage-এ খুবই critical.

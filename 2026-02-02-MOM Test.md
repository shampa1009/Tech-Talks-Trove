The biggest mistake in customer interviews? Asking for opinions.
Alternative: Our users aren't liars. We're just asking the wrong questions.

It’s not their fault. People are nice. They want to be supportive. When we ask, “Do you like this feature?” or “Would you use this?” we’re asking for an opinion, and we’ll get polite encouragement, not the truth.

This is the core lesson from The Mom Test (a game-changing short book). The goal isn't to validate our idea, but to understand the real problem.

Shift from opinions to behavior.
❌ “Would you buy this?” (Future promise = fiction)
✅ “How do you solve this now?” (Past behavior = truth)

The worst signal is enthusiasm. 🚩
“Sounds great! I’d totally use that.”
It feels good, but means nothing.

Real signals look like action:
✔They already pay for a hacky solution.
✔They’ve built manual workarounds.
✔They can describe the last time it hurt, specifically.

The mindset shift:
Stop trying to validate our idea.
Start working to understand the user's problem.

📌The Mom Test is about asking questions that make honesty the only option.

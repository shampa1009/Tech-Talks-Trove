💫 Product Manager 🤝 Dev Team
The perfect product duo isn't a rivalry; it's a partnership. 

We orbit the same product, but sometimes it feels like we speak different languages. But when a Product Manager's "Why" and a Dev Team's "How" align, that's where the magic happens.

At the end of the day, my "Let's ship it" and their "Let's ship it right" aren't conflicting goals. We're not on opposite sides. We're two essential forces, balancing each other to build something truly great. My "right thing" needs your "thing right" to succeed.

So, to all the incredible dev teams I've worked with: thank you for being the guardians of quality and the wizards of the possible. We build better, together.

🤝PM + Dev Team = Real magic happens

🌟 Pro-tip for survival: Great products happen when PMs and Devs build empathy, respect each other’s chaos, and occasionally buy each other tea/coffee ☕.

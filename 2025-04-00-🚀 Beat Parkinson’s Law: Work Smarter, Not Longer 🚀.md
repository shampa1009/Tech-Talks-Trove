🚀 Beat Parkinson’s Law: Work Smarter, Not Longer 🚀 

We’ve all been there: A task that could take 2 days somehow fills 2 weeks. That’s Parkinson’s Law in action: “Work expands to fill the time available.”

Why It Matters
🔹Deadlines dictate effort: Give a project 1 month? It’ll take 1 month.
🔹Trivial tasks eat time: Teams often over-discuss minor details (Parkinson’s Law of Triviality).
🔹Procrastination thrives: “Student Syndrome” means we start only when the deadline looms.

How to Fight Back
✅ Set deadlines – Break projects into sprints.
✅ Timebox tasks – Use techniques like Pomodoro (25-minute focus bursts).
 ⏱️ 1 Full Pomodoro Block (4 Cycles)
 Each Pomodoro cycle includes:
 🧠 25 minutes of focused work
 ⏸️ 5 minutes of break
 🔁 Repeat 4 times:
 Cycle Focus Time Break Time
 Pomodoro 1 25 mins 5 mins
 Pomodoro 2 25 mins 5 mins
 Pomodoro 3 25 mins 5 mins
 Pomodoro 4 25 mins 5 mins
 🧘‍♂️ Then: Take a longer break (15–30 minutes)
✅ Track time – Tools like Clockify reveal where hours go.
✅ Define “done” upfront – Prevent perfectionism from dragging out work.

Example: A 1-hour meeting could often be 30 minutes with a clear agenda.

🕷️ What Does a Web Crawler Really Do?

Imagine you're a librarian in a city with an infinite number of libraries. 📚
Your mission???
To visit each library, scan every book, and build an index so anyone can search and find knowledge instantly.

That’s exactly what a Web Crawler does, but for the internet.

Let me break it down with this fun analogy:
🏃‍♂️ You start with a list of libraries to visit → (Seed URLs)
📖 You enter a library, grab a book, and scan every page → (Download the web page)
🔗 Inside the book, you find references to other books and other libraries → (Extract links)
📝 You note down key content + where to find it → (Store content + metadata)
📌 You mark the library as visited so you don’t go back unnecessarily → (Avoid duplicates)
⏱️ You don’t barge in at midnight or too often → (Respect robots.txt and rate limits)
📦 You repeat this process millions of times across cities → (Scale to billions of pages)

🛠️ In a System Design Interview by Alex Xu, you're asked:
 “Design a scalable web crawler to index the entire web efficiently.”
You're now expected to:
✅Break down the system into fetcher, parser, scheduler, storage, and deduplication
✅Handle billions of URLs
✅Design for scale, failure recovery, and politeness
✅Prioritize fresh content (e.g. news vs old blogs)

⚙️ It’s not just about crawling.
It’s about crawling smart - like a courteous, memory-smart, high-speed librarian that never forgets, never repeats, and always plays nice. 😎

Next time you search for something on Google, remember - A web crawler got there first.

👉 Building features ≠ Building value

What is the Build Trap?
Teams stay busy shipping features, roadmaps stay full, sprints keep running - কিন্তু real user value বা business impact আসে না.

Because we measure output, not outcome.
Product ≠ Project
Product thinking asks “Why build?”, not just “What to build?”

📌 Outcome-driven roadmaps focus on: Business goals, User problems & Success metrics

📊 Measure what matters
 Stop asking, “Did we ship?”
 Start asking, “Did it move user behavior or business outcomes?”

✨ If we’re only building, we’re probably not learning.
 And if we’re not learning, we’re not building the right thing.

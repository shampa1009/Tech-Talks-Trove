Google Play (G Play) Payment Compliance - What Every App Owner in Bangladesh Must Know

Recently, we’ve seen multiple apps in Bangladesh getting flagged, suspended, or temporarily removed from the Google Play Store - mostly due to payment and/or other compliance issues.

This post is for any app owner, product manager, or founder who is building an Android app and dealing with monetization.

First, let’s understand the core G Play rule.

If your Android app sells:
 ✅Digital content
 ✅Subscriptions
 ✅In-app services

👉 Google Play requires you to use the G Play Billing System for in-app payments. This is the policy, and violating it is one of the most common reasons apps get flagged.

Now comes the real challenge for Bangladeshi apps.
Why G Play Billing is difficult for Bangladesh-based apps (for now). The majority of users pay using:
🔸bKash
🔸Nagad
🔸Rocket
🔸Upay
🔸Local debit cards

But G Play Billing does NOT support any Bangladeshi MFS or local cards. So realistically, only users with:
✔️International credit cards
✔️Limited carrier billing
can pay inside the app, which excludes a huge portion of users.

If you enable G Play Billing without understanding this:
🔹Users can’t complete payment
🔹Conversion drops
🔹Revenue takes a hit

Another critical point many people miss - commission & control.
Google charges:
🔹15% upto $1M revenue
🔹30% after that
Tax note: If we submit W-8BEN / W-8BEN-E correctly, US tax becomes 0% for non-US earnings.
Plus:
🔹Refunds
🔹Disputes
🔹Chargebacks
সবকিছু Google handle করে, which reduces a bit of control over customer experience.

📌 So what is the compliant alternative? Google policy allows apps to:
 ✔ Accept payments outside the app
 ✔ Use web checkout, as long as the app doesn’t mislead or bypass users

Many apps globally are moving towards a hybrid payment strategy:
 ✔G Play Billing, where feasible
 ✔Web checkout for local market dominance
Payment method may differ, but user access remains seamless.

📌 And yes, this is why the same product or subscription often has different prices on:
✔G Play Billing (in-app)
✔Local payment gateways/web checkout

📌 G Play compliance is not just a technical checkbox. এটা product decision, business strategy, এবং market understanding.

📌 If you’re building an app in Bangladesh, understand the policy first, then design your payment flow. It can save your app, your revenue, and your sleep.

🚦Rate Limit in System Design

Think of it as a traffic signal for requests. একসাথে অনেক request এলে server যেন overload না হয়, fair usage থাকে, আর abuse (bot spikes, brute force) আটকানো যায় - that’s the job of rate limiting.

✨ Example:
 ধরুন, আপনি একটি ticket booking app 🎟️ চালান। Big concert drop এ এক মুহূর্তে লাখ লাখ request
With Rate Limit → system requests কে queue/shape করে, fair slot দেয়, site stays up.
Without → thundering herd 🐘, DB saturation, cache meltdown, site crash ❌, angry users.

⚡ Impact
✅ Stability & uptime
🔐 Abuse/DoS protection
⚖️ Fair allocation (per user/app/key)
🚀 Predictable latency & better CX
📉 Cost control (protects downstream services)

😬 If you don’t use it
🐢 Slow responses → timeout storm
💥 Server/DB overload → cascading failures
😡 Unfairness (bots win, real users lose)
🔁 Retries amplify the outage

🧠 How Rate Limiting works (concept)
Incoming requests → classified (by IP/user/API key/endpoint) → counted over a time window → if the counter crosses the limit ⇒ block/slow/queue the extra requests; otherwise allow. Server replies with helpful headers (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests, Retry-After).

🛠️ How to implement (common algorithms)
🪣 Token Bucket: fixed refill rate; each request spends a token. Bursts allowed up to bucket size.
💧 Leaky Bucket: requests drain at a constant rate; smooths bursts—extra flows overflow (drop).
⏲️ Fixed Window: count per time window (e.g., 100 req/min). Simple, but edge bursts are possible.
🪟 Sliding Window (log or rolling): more accurate fairness; counts over the last N seconds.

📍 Where to enforce
🌐 API Gateway/Reverse Proxy (NGINX/Envoy/Kong): cheap, centralized, fast.
🧩 App Layer: business-aware limits (per plan/feature).
☁️ CDN/WAF (Cloudflare/AWS): edge throttling against bots/DoS.
🔄 Client-side: backoff to play nice with your own APIs.

💡 Rate Limit = আপনার system-এর gatekeeper 🚧- it keeps things fair, fast, and alive when traffic spikes.

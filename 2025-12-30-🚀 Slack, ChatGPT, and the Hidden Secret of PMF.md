🚀 Slack, ChatGPT, and the Hidden Secret of PMF

📌 Slack never planned to be Slack.
They were building a game. The game failed. But যখন টিমের ইন্টারনাল চ্যাট টুল বন্ধ করতে চাইল… সবাই রেগে গেল।
That frustration? → That’s product-market fit.

📌 Same with ChatGPT.
AI hype wasn’t enough. People use it daily because it actually solves problems. Emails faster, code fixes quicker, complex topics instantly explained.

📌 On the flip side…
Folding phones? Cool tech, massive budget — but no real consumer pain solved.
Result? Low adoption, high return rate.

💡Market doesn’t care about your innovation.
💡Market cares about its own pain.

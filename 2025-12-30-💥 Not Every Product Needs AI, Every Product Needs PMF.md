💥 Not Every Product Needs AI, Every Product Needs PMF

আজকাল সব জায়গায় “AI-powered” ট্যাগ—
AI email, AI analytics, AI everything.

But the question is:

Do people really need the AI?
Or do they just need their problem solved… faster, easier, cheaper?

This is where most startups miss the plot.

PMF = alignment between real market pain and your product’s ability to solve it.

If you don’t have PMF yet:
 1️⃣ Talk to users (real conversation — not assumption)
 2️⃣ Focus on retention over reach
 3️⃣ Don’t scale before validation
 4️⃣ Be ready to pivot (Slack, Instagram, Twitter all did)
 5️⃣ Narrow down your niche — dominate a small market first

 PMF ছাড়া growth মানে uphill battle.
 PMF পাওয়া গেলে growth feels like downhill skating. 😄

🎯Great products don’t start great. They become great by learning, listening, iterating.

🚀 Keep going. PMF changes everything.

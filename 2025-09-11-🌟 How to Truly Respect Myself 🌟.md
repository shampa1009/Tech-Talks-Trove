🌟 How to Truly Respect Myself 🌟
I often think respect comes from others, but it starts with I.

Here are some timeless reminders:
👀 I value my presence: I don’t chase those who don’t see my worth.
 🤐 I speak less, listen more, my words shape 80% of how others value me.
 💼 I invest in myself, skills, growth, and happiness are my best assets.
 🚪 I walk away from spaces and relationships where I feel undervalued.
 🎁 I give more than I take, but I know my limits.
 ✨ I look sharp, presentation matters.
 ⏰ I protect my time, I say no when I need to.
 🔥 I strive to be the best at what I do, excellence earns respect faster than demands.

Respect isn’t demanded; it’s cultivated. When I live by these principles, people have no choice but to treat me the way I deserve.

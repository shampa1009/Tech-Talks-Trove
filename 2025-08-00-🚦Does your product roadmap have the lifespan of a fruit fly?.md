🚦Does your product roadmap have the lifespan of a fruit fly?

You know… just when you’re ready to start a big project, it changes its mind every two months?

Most Product Management books promise you the dream:
🔹Stick to one vision 🏁
🔹Follow a clear strategy 📅
🔹Plan far ahead so you can solve big, important problems 🧠
Then, in the same breath, they say:
🔸Be agile! 🏃‍♂️
🔸Chase the hottest opportunity in the next sprint 💥
🔸Reprioritize constantly for “maximum value” 🔄
So… which is it? Strategy monk or sprint cowboy?

Here’s what reality usually looks like:
Your “strategic vision” is beautifully framed… on paper. Meanwhile, you’re juggling:
🔹Bugs that keep respawning 🐛
🔹Emergency requests from Sales 📞
🔹Stability fires 🔥
🔹Urgent marketing campaigns 📢
🔹SDK & certificate updates 📜
🔹User ratings that must stay high ⭐
🔹Branding changes 🎨
🔹Tech debt that’s now an actual debt 💳
Every sprint becomes a survival game: What’s going to break first?

Is there a cure?
Not really. But here’s the survival kit:
🔸Reserve part of your roadmap for “Keep the Lights On” work 💡
🔸Put all tasks in one backlog and let the prioritization framework decide
🔸Make your prioritization process transparent, data beats opinion
🔸Accept you can’t do it all (someone will be upset, that’s fine!)
🔸Always play the long game for your career 🛡️

So… do we really have time to purely focus on “user needs”?
 I’ll let you decide.

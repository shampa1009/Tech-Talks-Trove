📱 Web App vs PWA vs Native App — A Product Decision, Not a Tech Debate

 “Should we build a Web, PWA, or Native App?”
Short answer: It depends on the problem we’re solving.

🌐 Web App
 Great for fast launch & validation.
 Low cost, quick iteration, but limited engagement.
 👉 Best when acquisition is the goal.

⚡PWA (Progressive Web App)
 Web-এর flexibility + App-এর feel.
 Offline support, installable, fast loading, & no app store friction.
 👉 Ideal for growth-focused products, especially emerging markets.

📲 Native App
 Best performance, deep device access, strongest retention.
 But higher cost, slower release cycles.
 👉 Choose when engagement, complexity & monetization matter most.

 Technology is not the starting point.
 📌User pain point + business goal = right platform choice.

🎯 Start with Web/PWA to learn fast → move to Native when scale demands it.
